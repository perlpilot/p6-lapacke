Perl 6 interface to LAPACK libs. See http://www.netlib.org/lapack/

This is just an experiment and *VERY* alpha code.

Must have lapacke (the C API to LAPACK) and the C header files already
installed. If on ubuntu-ish OS, try

    sudo apt-get install liblapacke-dev

The Perl6 lib is built from the C header file /usr/include/lapacke.h.
To build it, run:

    tools/make-lapacke

and for a simple test, run

    perl6 -Ilib examples/dgels-test-row
